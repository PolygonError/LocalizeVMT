### Use

`LocalizeVMT <path-to-vmt-folder>`

The folder must be in the `materials` directory of a Source Engine game.
This was intended to be used to fix texture packs (I specifically made it to fix the Facepunch Asset Collaboration pack)
It will not work for all paths, as many may be in the game's files or simply do not exist.
It will save over the existing VMT, so make sure you have a backup because it could fuck up.
